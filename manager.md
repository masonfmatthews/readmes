# Mason Matthews' Manager README

I'm not convinced that having "managers" is right for every company, but as you grow, I think good ones can help you scale.  I have spent time as an individual contributor and time as a manager.  If I happen to be managing you, here's what you probably want to know.

### What you should expect from me

As a team lead of any variety, I see it as my responsibility to:

* Get to know team members well, and talk openly and often about how things are going
* Help the team reach consensus
* Hold the team accountable to the decisions and standards we've come up with together
* Continually re-evaluate the way we do things

If I'm in a formal "manager" role, with employees reporting directly to me, I think it's important to also:

* Provide the support my reports need to grow and to do their best possible work
* Set expectations for outcomes, not micromanage tasks
* Oversee the selection process for new team members
* Buffer the team from stresses imposed by other business units
* Bear responsibility for our plans and performance within the company and without

### What we should expect of each other

In any professional relationship (including a management relationship), I think we should:

* Put effort towards empathizing with each other.  We may disagree or get frustrated, but we should always seek to know each other's reasoning.
* Have open, frequent communication.  Be capable of alternating between being a student, peer, and teacher.
* Offer feedback at all times, but make it actionable.  Feedback loops are how we improve and grow, but we shouldn't spend time dwelling on the past or casting blame.  Feedback is only useful if it is forward-looking.

### What I expect from you

In exchange for the support and buffering that I intend to provide to you, I'd ask the following:

* Take the initiative in problem solving.  Seek solutions of your own rather than waiting to implement a solution given to you.
* Build small feedback cycles into your work.  Run experiments as often as possible and allow the results to change your plans.
* Seek the greatest areas of risk in your tasks and address them first.  We can gravitate to working on sub-problems we already know how to do, but that can cause us to spend time on a macro task that ends up being insurmountable.
* Keep no sacred cows.  If you see a better way to do ANYTHING, we should talk about it.
* Give the team's decisions a chance.  You may disagree with the way we decide to go, and sometimes you'll have to ride it out for a while.  It's not forever, though.  When a decision doesn't go your way, let's schedule a time to revisit once we've accumulated some results.

### When you should start yelling at me

I am actually of the opinion that bad management is unethical.  If you try to quantify the suffering that it causes in the world, I think it's up there as one of the major sources.   I take the responsibility of management very seriously, and while I'm bound to make some mistakes, I know that I should never do the following:

* Act like I can your job better than you
* Take the credit for your work
* Ignore your opinions
* Give you embarrassing feedback in front of others

I expect you to call me out if I do anything terrible like this!
